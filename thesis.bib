We consider both second-order "classical" asymptotics, in which the interface thickness is taken much smaller than the capillary length, and the new "isothermal" asymptotics, in which the two lengths are considered comparable. In the first case, if the phase field model is required to be gradient flow for an entropy functional, then for unequal diffusivities it is impossible to construct a phase equation with finite kinetics which converges with second-order accuracy to a Gibbs-Thomson equilibrium condition with infinitely fast kinetics. In the second case, some error terms are pushed to higher orders, and it is easy to eliminate the remaining errors with finite phase kinetics.},

  abstract         = {A lattice-Boltzmann (LB) scheme, based on the Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision rules is developed for a phase-field model of alloy solidification in order to simulate the growth of dendrites. The solidification of a binary alloy is considered, taking into account diffusive transport of heat and solute, as well as the anisotropy of the solid-liquid interfacial free energy. The anisotropic terms in the phase-field evolution equation, the phenomenological anti-trapping current (introduced in the solute evolution equation to avoid spurious solute trapping), and the variation of the solute diffusion coefficient between phases, make it necessary to modify the equilibrium distribution functions of the LB scheme with respect to the one used in the standard method for the solution of advection-diffusion equations. The effects of grid anisotropy are removed by using the lattices D3Q15 and D3Q19 instead of D3Q7. The method is validated by direct comparison of the simulation results with a numerical code that uses the finite-difference method. Simulations are also carried out for two different anisotropy functions in order to demonstrate the capability of the method to generate various crystal shapes.},

  abstract         = {We address a “multi-reflection” approach to model Dirichlet and Neumann time-dependent boundary conditions in lattice Boltzmann methods for arbitrarily shaped surfaces. The multi-reflection condition for an incoming population represents a linear combination of the known population solutions. The closure relations are first established for symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of the equilibrium functions, independently of the nature of the problem. The symmetric part is tuned to build second- and third-order accurate Dirichlet boundary conditions for the scalar function specified by the equilibrium distribution. The focus is on two approaches to advection and anisotropic-dispersion equations (AADE): the equilibrium technique when the coefficients of the expanded equilibrium functions match the coefficients of the transformed dispersion tensor, and the eigenvalue technique when the coefficients of the dispersion tensor are built as linear combinations of the eigenvalue functions associated with the link-type collision operator. As a particular local boundary technique, the “anti-bounce-back” condition is analyzed. The anti-symmetric part of the generic closure relation allows to specify normal flux conditions without inversion of the diffusion tensor. Normal and tangential constraints are derived for bounce-back and specular reflections. The bounce-back closure relation is released from the non-physical tangential flux restriction at leading orders. Solutions for the Poisson equation and for convection-diffusion equations are presented for isotropic/anisotropic configurations with specified Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a numerical method with high parallel computational efficiency. However, currently few 3D numerical wave model based on LBM can be widely applied to water wave simulations in coastal engineering due to several problems related to numerical instability and numerical accuracy. To develop a high-performance 3D LBM solver for water wave simulations with free surface capture, a new 3D collision operator with sufficient numerical stability for wave simulation is first proposed. Then, wave generation and active wave absorption methods for the volume of fluid coupled with LBM are implemented in the solver to ensure accurate wave motion. The performances of this solver and other popular numerical wave solvers are analyzed and compared. The parameters of the numerical model are tested and determined to simulate wave transformation around structures. Through the comparison with three benchmark physical experiments, the accuracy of the presented solver proves that the present model is a promising tool for wave propagation and transformation simulation in practice. Benchmark tests and comparisons with the IHFoam and SPHysics solvers prove that the 3D LBM solver developed in this paper has a very good computational efficiency and parallel scalability. Overall, the work in this paper provides a new high-performance 3D solver for water wave simulations with free surface capturing for coastal and ocean engineering applications.},

By a direct analogy with the constitutional supercooling criterion in alloy solidification, it has been proposed that the instability in ternary two-phase diffusion couples occurs when either or both diffusion paths enter into the two-phase region of the phase diagram. In this work a linear stability analysis of the diffusion problem is performed and the conditions for stability are expressed in terms of the diffusion coefficients, the slopes of the concentration profiles at the interface, and the system free energy as a function of composition. Through the use of a model ternary system, various examples of unstable interfaces are illustrated. It is found that the crossing of a diffusion path into the two-phase coexistence region is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for instability.},

All simulations are based on the assumption that the γ-phase is continuous throughout the whole diffusion couple with β and/or γ' as secondary phases. Further, the model is incorporated into the DICTRA software, which means that the simulations are based upon critically assessed thermodynamic and kinetic data. Diffusion paths are predicted for several different types of diffusion couple. The simulation results are in general agreement with both experimental as well as theoretical findings and it is concluded that the present model can be applied to predict interdiffusion in important industrial applications, e.g. high temperature coatings.},

  abstract = {Currently accepted mechanistic models describing aqueous corrosion of borosilicate glasses are based on diffusion-controlled hydrolysis, hydration, ion exchange reactions, and subsequent re-condensation of the hydrolyzed glass network, leaving behind a residual hydrated glass or gel layer. Here, we report results of novel oxygen and silicon isotope tracer experiments with ternary Na borosilicate glasses that can be better explained by a process that involves the congruent dissolution of the glass, which is spatially and temporally coupled to the precipitation and growth of an amorphous silica layer at an inwardly moving reaction interface. Such a process is thermodynamically driven by the solubility difference between the glass and amorphous silica, and kinetically controlled by glass dissolution reactions at the reaction front, which, in turn, are controlled by the transport of water and solute elements through the growing corrosion zone. Understanding the coupling of these reactions is the key to understand the formation of laminar or more complex structural and chemical patterns observed in natural corrosion zones of ancient glasses. We suggest that these coupled processes also have to be considered to realistically model the long-term performance of silicate glasses in aqueous environments.},

Three domains are investigated: (a) the case where the entropy production is reduced to adsorption and chemical reaction, with the equilibrium as a special case; (b) the linear nonequilibrium thermodynamics initiated by Onsager; (c) the nonlinear region characterized by an excess entropy production. In some cases, far from equilibrium, the surface may become unstable after a threshold. Self-organization such as space and temporal dissipative structures may then occur in the surface.},

These range from controlling and developing interface-width independent modelling; controlling morphology in both single and multiphase settings; generalising from single to multiphase models; and creating a thermodynamically consistent framework for modelling entropy flow and thereby postulating a temperature field consistent with the concepts of, and applicable in, multiphase and density-dependent settings.},

These materials were characterized using in situ/ex situ Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS), and ex-situ by nitrogen adsorption-desorption and 29Si Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The results have shown that MCM41 lost its hexagonal order of pores. This phenomenon has been attributed to a change of the pore shape probably due to the dissolution of silica wall and to the recondensation of hydrolysed silica on the pore surface leading also to a partial pore clogging at high alteration progress. In the case of SBA15, as soon as the porous silica is in contact with water, an altered silica layer is formed at the pore surface and dissolved at a rate of 120 nm year-1 leading to a pore size increase. When an equilibrium between dissolution and recondensation of the silica is reached, the silica dissolution rate strongly decreases (7 nm year-1) and the altered layer growth follows a diffusive process with a diffusion coefficient of D = 1.4 × 10-24 m2 s-1. The differences of evolution between the two silica are explained by their different pore diameter and the presence of microporosity in the case of SBA15. © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Based on the discrete element method (DEM) and the multiphase fluid model in the framework of the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), a multiphase fluid-solid two-way coupling algorithm is proposed. In this model, the fluid-fluid interface is tracked using a phase-field method, and the multiphase fluid-particle interaction is tackled by a combination of the momentum exchange method for the flow field and the immersed boundary method for the phase field. We applied the method to simulate the upward migration of the leaked gas bubbles through a brine-filled sediment column at the seafloor, and investigated the influences of the leak flow rate and the interfacial tension on the bubble rising behavior. The results indicate three different flow regimes: connected finger flow, transition flow, and dispersed bubbly flow. These flow regimes can be distinguished by the dimensionless Eötvös and Weber numbers. The proposed numerical method can accurately characterize various multiphase interaction mechanisms at the mesoscopic scale and has powerful advantages in simulating complex fluid-particle coupling problems.},

  abstract  = {The paper presents an approach that extends the flexibility of the standard lattice Boltzmann single relaxation time scheme in terms of spatial variation of dissipative terms (e.g., diffusion coefficient) and stability for high Péclet mass transfer problems. Spatial variability of diffusion coefficient in SRT is typically accommodated through the variation of relaxation time during the collision step. This method is effective but cannot deal with large diffusion coefficient variations, which can span over several orders of magnitude in some natural systems. The approach explores an alternative way of dealing with large diffusion coefficient variations in advection-diffusion transport systems by introducing so-called diffusion velocity. The diffusion velocity is essentially an additional convective term that replaces variations in diffusion coefficients vis-à-vis a chosen reference diffusion coefficient which defines the simulation time step. Special attention is paid to the main idea behind the diffusion velocity formulation and its implementation into the lattice Boltzmann framework. Finally, the performance, stability, and accuracy of the diffusion velocity formulation are discussed via several advection-diffusion transport benchmark examples. These examples demonstrate improved stability and flexibility of the proposed scheme with marginal consequences on the numerical performance. © 2014 American Physical Society.},

This expression is used to determine the properties of a flat interface between two coexisting phases. In particular, we find that the thickness of the interface increases with increasing temperature and becomes infinite at the critical temperature Tc, and that at a temperature T just below Tc the interfacial free energy σ is proportional to (T c-T)1/2. The predicted interfacial free energy and its temperature dependence are found to be in agreement with existing experimental data. The possibility of using optical measurements of the interface thickness to provide an additional check of our treatment is briefly discussed.},

  abstract  = {It is suggested that a system of chemical substances, called morphogens, reacting together and diffusing through a tissue, is adequate to account for the main phenomena of morphogenesis. Such a system, although it may originally be quite homogeneous, may later develop a pattern or structure due to an instability of the homogeneous equilibrium, which is triggered off by random disturbances. Such reaction-diffusion systems are considered in some detail in the case of an isolated ring of cells, a mathematically convenient, though biologically unusual system. The investigation is chiefly concerned with the onset of instability. It is found that there are six essentially different forms which this may take. In the most interesting form stationary waves appear on the ring. It is suggested that this might account, for instance, for the tentacle patterns on Hydra and for whorled leaves. A system of reactions and diffusion on a sphere is also considered. Such a system appears to account for gastrulation. Another reaction system in two dimensions gives rise to patterns reminiscent of dappling. It is also suggested that stationary waves in two dimensions could account for the phenomena of phyllotaxis. The purpose of this paper is to discuss a possible mechanism by which the genes of a zygote may determine the anatomical structure of the resulting organism. The theory does not make any new hypotheses; it merely suggests that certain well-known physical laws are sufficient to account for many of the facts. The full understanding of the paper requires a good knowledge of mathematics, some biology, and some elementary chemistry. Since readers cannot be expected to be experts in all of these subjects, a number of elementary facts are explained, which can be found in text-books, but whose omission would make the paper difficult reading.},

  abstract  = {Understanding the dissolution of silicate glasses and minerals from atomic to macroscopic levels is a challenge with major implications in geoscience and industry. One of the main uncertainties limiting the development of predictive models lies in the formation of an amorphous surface layer––called gel––that can in some circumstances control the reactivity of the buried interface. Here, we report experimental and simulation results deciphering the mechanisms by which the gel becomes passivating. The study conducted on a six-oxide borosilicate glass shows that gel reorganization involving high exchange rate of oxygen and low exchange rate of silicon is the key mechanism accounting for extremely low apparent water diffusivity (∼10−21 m2 s−1), which could be rate-limiting for the overall reaction. These findings could be used to improve kinetic models, and inspire the development of new molecular sieve materials with tailored properties as well as highly durable glass for application in extreme environments. Deciphering the dissolution process of silicate glasses and minerals from atomic to macroscopic scales is a major challenge. Here, the authors explain the passivating properties of the gel layer by its reorganization, which is a key mechanism accounting for very low apparent water diffusivity.},

  abstract  = {Diffusion of hydrogen bearing species in glasses plays a significant role in numerous applications in commercial as well as scientific domains. The investigation of diffusion of water in glasses at low temperatures led to experimental and analytical difficulties in the past. We present a new approach that lets us overcome these complications. Diffusion couples of An50Di50 glass (mol %, NBO/T = 0.67) were produced by coating anhydrous glass substrates with thin films of hydrated glass (~200 nm, ~2 wt% H2O) using pulsed laser deposition (PLD). Bonding the diffusant to the glass matrix of the thin film instead of using free water at the interface during experiments precludes other glass altering processes such as dissolution and precipitation. This allows us to confidently interpret the measured profiles to be a result of diffusion only. Nanoscale concentration profiles that result from diffusion at low temperatures on experimentally feasible time scales were measured with the Nuclear Resonance Reaction Analysis (NRRA, 1H(15N,αγ)12C). The non-destructive nature of NRRA enables us to observe and better understand the evolution of diffusion profiles with time within one sample. Evaluation of the sample quality by EPMA, SEM, optical microscopy, Rutherford backscattering spectroscopy (RBS), and NRRA was performed and confirmed the suitability of the samples for diffusion studies. Experiments at 1 atm in a box furnace and at 2 kbar in a CSPV (pressure medium = water) and an IHPV (pressure medium = Argon) prove that the diffusion couples can be used under various experimental conditions. We present diffusion profiles that were measured in experiments carried out in these devices and discuss the distinct features of each that result from different boundary conditions in the experiments.},

   samples of quartz, silicas and silicas outgassed at high temperatures
   using own and published data of the spreading pressure of water, its
   surface tension, its contact angle and using formulas obtained by the
   combination of the Young equation with a general equation of pair
   interaction. The values obtained for 18 different samples were in the
   range 7.80-6.92 kJ mol(-1). Lower values of energies are for samples
   that contain relatively less amounts of water at P/P-0 = 0.25 and are
   characterized also by relatively low values of surface pressures. (C)

  abstract  = {The influence of pore space heterogeneity on mineral dissolution and permeability evolution in porous media was investigated using a numerical approach. Artificial porous media were generated by the linear Boolean model, and pore heterogeneity was evaluated using the Euler-Poincaré characteristic (i.e., Euler number). We applied the lattice Boltzmann method with dual particle distribution functions to simulate mineral dissolution under the combined effect of fluid flow and a diffusion process. Simulations were conducted to investigate dissolution patterns for a wide range of Péclet (Pe) and Damköhler (Da) numbers and various pore geometries. Six dissolution regimes were observed, and two types of transition phenomena between these dissolution regimes could be characterized. At high Pe and Da, the dissolution patterns strongly depended on the pore heterogeneity. In addition, four types of porosity-permeability relationship were observed. These relationships were influenced by the pore heterogeneity at high Da numbers.},

  abstract  = {A description is given of the unusual X-ray diffraction effects
               shown by the alloy Cu 4 FeNi 3 while it is in the process of
               splitting up from one face-centred cubic structure into two.
               Before the formation of the tetragonal structures described by
               Bradley a state is formed in which each line of a powder
               photograph is accompanied by quite strong side-bands. An
               explanation of this is given and is shown to be in reasonable
               agreement with most of the quantitative data from the X-ray
               photographs. This explanation is that the original cubic lattice
               is regularly deformed by the segregation of the different atoms.
               From the positions of the side-bands the directions of the
               deformations and their average wave-length can be estimated. The
               intensities, however, do not fit in with the theory; they do not
               vary exactly in the way predicted. It is shown, however, that
               the variation is in closer agreement with this sort of
               modulation of the structure than with any other, but it has not,
               so far, been found possible to find any factor that will modify
               the intensities of the side-bands in the way required.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is concerned with establishing the conditions under which planar phase interfaces are morphologically unstable during phase transformations in isothermal ternary systems. First, linear perturbation methods are employed in a detailed treatment of precipitatematrix interface stability for dilute ternary systems. Following this, the stability of the planar interface in a two-phase ternary diffusion couple is examined with the aid of perturbation theory. An experimental investigation into the stability of <alpha>-<beta> phase interfaces in the Cu-Zn-Ni system at 775°C is described. The results of this experimental study are shown to be in good agreement with the earlier theoretical predictions.},
